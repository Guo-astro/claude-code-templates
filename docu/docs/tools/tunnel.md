# Cloudflare Tunnel

Enable secure remote access to your Claude Code tools from anywhere using Cloudflare's global network infrastructure.

## üåê What is Cloudflare Tunnel?

Cloudflare Tunnel creates secure, encrypted connections between your local Claude Code tools and the internet, allowing remote access without exposing your local network or compromising security.

## üöÄ Enable Tunnel

Cloudflare Tunnel works with other Claude Code tools by adding the `--tunnel` flag:

### With Analytics Dashboard
```bash
npx claude-code-templates@latest --analytics --tunnel
```

### With Chats Interface
```bash
npx claude-code-templates@latest --chats --tunnel
```

## üîß How It Works

### Secure Connection Process
1. **Tool Launch** - Your chosen tool (analytics or chats) starts locally
2. **Tunnel Creation** - Secure tunnel established through Cloudflare
3. **Public URL Generation** - Shareable HTTPS URL created
4. **Encrypted Traffic** - All traffic encrypted end-to-end
5. **Global Access** - Accessible from anywhere with internet

### Security Features
- **Zero Trust Access** - No open ports on your local network
- **End-to-end Encryption** - TLS encryption for all traffic
- **Cloudflare DDoS Protection** - Built-in attack mitigation
- **Global Network** - Cloudflare's edge network for performance
- **Automatic SSL** - HTTPS certificates managed automatically

## üéØ Use Cases

### Remote Development
- **Work from anywhere** - Access your Claude Code tools remotely
- **Travel productivity** - Maintain development workflow while traveling
- **Multiple locations** - Use from home, office, co-working spaces
- **Device flexibility** - Access from laptops, tablets, phones
- **Network independence** - Work on any internet connection

### Team Collaboration
- **Share analytics** - Give team members access to usage dashboards
- **Collaborative sessions** - Multiple people using chats interface
- **Remote pair programming** - Share Claude Code access for collaboration
- **Cross-timezone work** - Asynchronous access for global teams
- **Client demonstrations** - Show Claude Code capabilities securely

### Mobile and Cross-Device
- **Mobile access** - Use chats interface from mobile devices anywhere
- **Device switching** - Continue work across different devices
- **Backup access** - Alternative access when primary setup unavailable
- **Family/shared computers** - Access personal Claude Code from shared devices
- **Emergency access** - Critical development access during emergencies

## üîê Security Considerations

### Access Control
- **URL Security** - Generated URLs are cryptographically secure
- **Session Management** - Automatic session timeouts for security
- **No Port Exposure** - Local network remains completely protected
- **Cloudflare Monitoring** - Built-in traffic analysis and protection
- **Revocable Access** - Tunnels can be stopped to immediately revoke access

### Best Practices
- **Don't share URLs publicly** - Keep tunnel URLs private
- **Use strong authentication** - Secure your local Claude Code setup
- **Monitor access logs** - Check who's accessing your tools
- **Regular tunnel rotation** - Restart tunnels periodically for new URLs
- **Team access control** - Only share with trusted team members

### Data Privacy
- **Local processing** - Your code and data remain on your machine
- **Encrypted transmission** - All traffic encrypted in transit
- **No Cloudflare storage** - Cloudflare doesn't store your data
- **Private conversations** - Claude Code conversations stay private
- **Audit trail** - Monitor all remote access activity

## üìä Tunnel Management

### Active Tunnel Monitoring
- **Connection status** - Real-time tunnel health monitoring
- **Traffic analytics** - See usage patterns and access frequency
- **Performance metrics** - Monitor latency and connection quality
- **Error tracking** - Identify and resolve connection issues
- **Geographic access** - See where access is coming from

### URL Management
- **Secure URLs** - Each tunnel gets unique, secure URL
- **URL sharing** - Copy URLs for team collaboration
- **URL rotation** - Generate new URLs for security
- **Access logging** - Track who accesses shared URLs
- **URL expiration** - Set time limits on tunnel access

## üåç Global Performance

### Cloudflare Edge Network
- **200+ locations** - Global points of presence
- **Automatic routing** - Traffic routed to nearest edge
- **Load balancing** - Distributed traffic for reliability
- **Caching optimization** - Static assets cached globally
- **Bandwidth optimization** - Compression and optimization

### Connection Quality
- **Low latency** - Optimized routing for speed
- **High availability** - 99.9%+ uptime through redundancy
- **Scalable bandwidth** - Handles varying traffic loads
- **Quality monitoring** - Real-time performance tracking
- **Automatic failover** - Backup routes for reliability

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Tunnel Settings
- **Custom domains** - Use your own domain (advanced)
- **Access policies** - Control who can access tunnels
- **Traffic rules** - Configure routing and filtering
- **Bandwidth limits** - Set usage limits if needed
- **Geographic restrictions** - Limit access by location

### Integration Options
- **Multiple tools** - Run several tunneled tools simultaneously
- **Load balancing** - Distribute load across multiple instances
- **Health checks** - Automatic tunnel health monitoring
- **Backup tunnels** - Redundant tunnels for high availability
- **Custom routing** - Advanced traffic routing configurations

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tunnel won't start:**
```bash
# Check internet connection
ping cloudflare.com

# Verify tool is running locally first
npx claude-code-templates@latest --analytics
# Then add --tunnel flag
```

**Slow tunnel performance:**
- Check local internet speed
- Try different Cloudflare edge location
- Verify local tool performance without tunnel
- Check for network congestion

**Can't access tunnel URL:**
- Verify URL is correct and complete
- Check if tunnel is still active
- Try different browser or incognito mode
- Verify internet connection

### Performance Optimization
- **Optimize local tool** - Ensure base tool runs efficiently
- **Network stability** - Use stable internet connection
- **Browser optimization** - Keep browser updated
- **Clear caches** - Clear browser and tunnel caches
- **Monitor metrics** - Use analytics to identify bottlenecks

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Test locally first** - Ensure tools work properly before tunneling
- **Use descriptive naming** - Organize tunnel URLs for easy identification
- **Monitor access patterns** - Track usage to optimize performance
- **Combine with health checks** - Verify system health before sharing access
- **Document tunnel URLs** - Keep secure record for team access
- **Regular security reviews** - Periodically audit tunnel access and usage
- **Backup access methods** - Maintain alternative access options
